# Cybersecurity Research and Study Scripts

This Git repository contains a collection of scripts that I use for my cybersecurity-related research and study. These scripts are designed to assist in various tasks such as network analysis, penetration testing, and exploring different security concepts. 

## Files

The repository consists of the following files:

- `arpDetector.py`: This script detects Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing attacks within a local network.
- `arpSpoofer.py`: This script enables ARP spoofing, allowing the manipulation of ARP tables to intercept network traffic.
- `echoClient.py`: This script implements a simple client for testing echo server functionality.
- `echoServer.py`: This script sets up an echo server that echoes back any message received from the client.
- `openai_generator.py`: This script utilizes OpenAI's language model to generate text for various cybersecurity-related tasks.
- `pysharktest.py`: This script demonstrates the usage of PyShark, a Python wrapper for the Wireshark network analysis tool.
- `reverseShell.py`: This script creates a reverse shell, establishing a connection from a target machine to a listening server.
- `shellServer.py`: This script acts as a remote shell server, allowing command execution on a target machine.
- `test_code.py`: This script contains test code for verifying the functionality of other scripts.
- `todo.txt`: This file contains a list of tasks and ideas for future enhancements or additions to the scripts.

## Usage

Each script is designed to be run independently, and they have specific use cases. Before running any script, please ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured properly. Detailed instructions for running each script can be found within their respective files as comments or in the accompanying documentation.
